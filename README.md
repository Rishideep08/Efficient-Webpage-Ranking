# Efficient-Webpage-Ranking

- Implemented the classic page rank algorithm on Wiki Articles Edge Relationship database using Hadoop HDFS and PySpark.
- Performed Optimizations by tuning map reduce jobs with distributed techniques like data partitioning, shuffling and persistence caching. such that the inter communication between these jobs is minimal, which resulted in faster job completion time.
- When we tested the algorithms for 10 iterations and compared the stats. We observed a 10% decline in the computation time.
